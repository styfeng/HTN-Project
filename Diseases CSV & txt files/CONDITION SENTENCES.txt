hey there. i have been feeling extremely bad lately, with a fever developing the past few days;i have been getting lot of blisters and rashes on my body recently. my mouth has also been very sore in a lot of places and there has been itchiness all over my body; i went to my friend's house last night and ended up developing a fever and red spots al over my body. i couldn't even eat anything because i had no appetite, and started getting itchy all over my body; my mouth has been feeling bad lately, and i never feel like eating. my muscles have also been more sore lately even though i have not been to the gym, and my skin has become more itchy recently;blisters and rashes have appeared all over my body recently, and they have all started to itch. my arms and hamstrings are also starting to ache and i believe i may be developing a fever because my temperature is high from the last measurement;red spots are appealing all over my arm, and they are feeling quite uncomfortable. just this morning, i ended up developing a fever and my mouth has felt very sore and uncomfortable;my friend gabrielle and i went to the the movies and i ended up developing rashes all over my body which turned into itchy spots. later that night, i also measured my temperature and had developed a fever. this morning, i cannot even move well because my muscles are aching greatly.


my muscles are also hurting and ache quite a lot. it's also weird because my mother was home last weekend and we prepared a big dinner, but i had no appetite;completing tasks and doing things has been very difficult lately, as i seem to not remember things i did in the past. doing things i was faimiliar with has been confusing and felt out of place, and it appears my spatial and visual senses are also diminishing
