iDoc - Medical Conditions Automatic Classifier

iDoc is an iOS app that asks the user to talk or write about their medical symptoms. It uses machine learning (including speech-to-text, natural language processing, and neural networks) to check which medical conditions the user most likely has, and then gives advice on how to proceed. May it be immediately going to an ER or just resting well, iDoc gives a preliminary diagnosis for those who are unsure about whether or not to seek medical attention. It is built with Python, Swift, TensorFlow, Keras, etc.

Various implementations of the backend (Tensorflow, Scikit-Learn, Keras) can be found in the various folders. A folder containing diseases, symptoms, and other information in the form of CSV and txt files can also be found. Files related to CoreML conversion are in their corresponding folder.
